# SI_GameProject_Phase2
Names: Laia Ejarque, Nerea Ferrara, Candela √Ålvarez

Functionalities Implemented:
- When an ingredient matches with the position of the pattern ingredient in the pizza, the object is dropped automatically fitting the pattern. It only analyzes if the position matches with the pattern of that same ingredient and not with all of them.
  
- The ingredient will not be automatically set if there is already an ingredient dropped in that position.
  
- Set background music.
  
- Set music sound when dropping ingredient.
  
- When the pizza puzzle is complete, it will change of scene, to the cooking scene.

Our project is still under development, its current state is the implementation of the first scene. 
Our next step will focus on implementing the collaborative part of the game where users will rotate around the pizza to cook it, and to improve our functionalities implemented up to now.

Regarding the build project we include the BuildsProject folder zip + the executable inside the release and the BuildsProject folder inside of the github project.
